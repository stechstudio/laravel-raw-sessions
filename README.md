Raw PHP session handler for Laravel
====================

As of version 4.1.0 Laravel has removed the native session handler, and made it simply an alias for their file handler.

This handler gives that back.

Why would you want this?
====================

Really you shouldn't want this. Laravel's own session management has some very cool advantages, and you should really use it. 

Except when you can't.

Sometimes you may have a separate non-Laravel PHP app running on the same domain, that needs full session sharing. In our case, it was a legacy app that was being refactored in Laravel, but needed complete session sharing in the meantime.

Setup
====================

First off add the composer dependency:

    "require": {
        "stechstudio/laravel-raw-sessions" : "0.1.*"

Then of course update composer:

    composer update

Now add the service provider to the array in `config/app.php`:

    'providers' => array(
        ...
        'STS\Session\LaravelRawSessionServiceProvider',

Finally in `config/session.php` set the `driver` to `raw`:

    'driver' => 'raw',

That's it! All your Laravel `Session` calls will be reading and writing to the raw `$_SESSION` array.

Namespace the session
====================

You may wish to avoid polluting the root `$_SESSION` array, if you are sharing the session with other apps.

To change this, specify a `namespace` param in `config/session.php`:

    'driver' => 'raw',
    'namespace' => 'mynamespace',

This will cause Laravel to store all its session data under `$_SESSION['mynamespace']`.
